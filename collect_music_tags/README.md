`collect_music_tags.py` reads in a list of `artists` and `titles` from a CSV file that should be formatted as follows:

	Artist,Title
	Bob Dylan,blowing in the wind
	U2,Iris (hold me close)
	Badfinger,Baby blue
	Red hot chili peppers,by the way

A progress bar ([`pyprind`](https://github.com/rasbt/pyprind)) will show the progress during the download process. 

	> ./collect_music_tags.py -i ./examples/artist_title.csv -o out.csv
	0%  100%
	[####] | ETA[sec]: 0.000
	Total time elapsed: 2.230 sec

And the output CSV file will look as follows (here shown as screenshot using a spread sheet application):
