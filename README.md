# datacollect


**A collection of tools to collect and download various data.**

Often, I write simple scripts and tools to collect data for various "data science" tasks. I thought that it might be worthwhile to collect them in a central repository since they might be useful to others!

#### Contents
- [Collect Lyrics](./collect_lyrics)
- [Twitter Timeline](./twitter_timeline)
- [Collect Popular Music Tags](./collect_music_tags)
- [PDB Info Table](./pdb_infotable)
- [ZINC Molecule Downloader](./zinc_downloader)
- [Collect English Premier League Soccer Data](./collect_fantasysoccer)

<br>

**Important Note**  
Please note that I developed and tested these tools in Python 3.x, and it could be possible that the scripts do not work flawlessly in Python 2.7.x due to the more challenging unicode handling.
